          <p>Marvin Hagler is undoubtedly one of the greatest  boxers of all time, reigning supreme as undisputed middle weight champion from 1980 to 1987.He made twelve successful title defenses in that period, all by knockout save one. He was one of the luminaries in the much lauded late 70's to early 80's "era of the four kings" (Roberto Duran, Marvelous Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leanard, Thomas "Hitman" Hearns).</p>
